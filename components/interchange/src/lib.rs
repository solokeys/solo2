#![no_std]
//! Implement a somewhat convenient and somewhat efficient way to perform RPC
//! in an embedded context.
//!
//! The approach is inspired by Go's channels, with the restriction that
//! there is a clear separation into a requester and a responder.
//!
//! Requests may be canceled, which the responder should honour on a
//! best-effort basis.
//!
//! For each pair of `Request` and `Response` types, the macro `interchange!`
//! generates a type that implements the `Interchange` trait.
//!
//! The `Requester` and `Responder` types (to send/cancel requests, and to
//! respond to such demands) are generic with only this one type parameter.
//!
//! ### Example use cases
//! - USB device interrupt handler performs low-level protocol details, hands off
//!   commands from the host to higher-level logic running in the idle thread.
//!   This higher-level logic need only understand clearly typed commands, as
//!   moduled by variants of a given `Request` enum.
//! - `trussed` crypto service, responding to crypto request from apps across
//!   TrustZone for Cortex-M secure/non-secure boundaries.
//! - Request to blink a few lights and reply on button press
//!
//! ```
//! # use interchange::Interchange as _;
//! # use interchange::State;
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
//! pub enum Request {
//!     This(u8, u32),
//!     That(i64),
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
//! pub enum Response {
//!     Here(u8, u8, u8),
//!     There(i16),
//! }
//!
//! interchange::interchange! {
//!     ExampleInterchange: (Request, Response)
//! }
//!
//! let (mut rq, mut rp) = ExampleInterchange::claim().unwrap();
//!
//! assert!(rq.state() == State::Idle);
//!
//! // happy path: no cancelation
//! let request = Request::This(1, 2);
//! assert!(rq.request(request).is_ok());
//!
//! let request = rp.take_request().unwrap();
//! println!("rp got request: {:?}", &request);
//!
//! let response = Response::There(-1);
//! assert!(!rp.is_canceled());
//! assert!(rp.respond(response).is_ok());
//!
//! let response = rq.take_response().unwrap();
//! println!("rq got response: {:?}", &response);
//!
//! // early cancelation path
//! assert!(rq.request(request).is_ok());
//!
//! let request =  rq.cancel().unwrap().unwrap();
//! println!("responder could cancel: {:?}", &request);
//!
//! assert!(rp.take_request().is_none());
//! assert!(State::Idle == rq.state());
//!
//! // late cancelation
//! assert!(rq.request(request).is_ok());
//! let request = rp.take_request().unwrap();
//!
//! println!("responder could cancel: {:?}", &rq.cancel().unwrap().is_none());
//! assert!(rp.is_canceled());
//! assert!(rp.respond(response).is_err());
//! assert!(rp.acknowledge_cancel().is_ok());
//! assert!(State::Idle == rq.state());
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ### Approach
//! It is assumed that all requests fit in a single `Request` enum, and that
//! all responses fit in single `Response` enum. The macro `interchange!`
//! allocates a static buffer in which either response or request fit, and
//! handles synchronization.
//!
//! An alternative approach would be to use two heapless Queues of length one
//! each for response and requests. The advantage of our construction is to
//! have only one static memory region in use.
//!
//! ### Safety
//! It is possible that this implementation is currently not sound. To be determined!
//!
//! Due to the macro construction, certain implementation details are more public
//! than one would hope for: the macro needs to run in the code of users of this
//! library. We take a somewhat Pythonic "we're all adults here" approach, in that
//! the user is expected to only use the publicly documented API (the ideally private
//! details are hidden from documentation).
