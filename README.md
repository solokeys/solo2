## üêù SoloKeys Solo 2 monorepo.

This repository contains the "runner" for the firmware on Solo 2 devices.

Please note that many components have been contributed to the [Trussed GitHub Organization][trussed-dev]:

- Framework: https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed
- FIDO Authenticator: https://github.com/trussed-dev/fido-authenticator
- PIV Authenticator: https://github.com/trussed-dev/piv-authenticator

Such code is co-maintained with Nitrokey, who have contributed extensions and other improvements.

We plan to release a new version of the firmware, incorporating these changes.

## Support

For support with purchased devices, please reach out to hello@solokeys.com.

To repeat: Please **do not** open issues/PRs that are not technical issues / firmware bugs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your system.

- Install dependencies such as clang, llvm, arm-none-eabi-gdb, flip-link

- Get and prepare hardware
- Run `make build-dev`.

For more information: <https://hackmd.io/@solokeys/solo2-getting-started>.
Please **do not** send PRs to expand on getting started generalities, just edit the linked HackMD directly.


### Boards

Head to [runnners/lpc55/board](runners/lpc55/board) for an overview on the possible embedded platforms the firmware currently supports.

### Compiling

Head to [runners/lpc55](runners/lpc55) to get started, and try `make build-dev`, which compiles
the entire firmware bundle using features convenient for getting started.

With `make run-dev`, it will try to connect to a GDB server to flash and run the firmware.
One way to run a GDB server is `JLinkGDBServer -strict -device LPC55S69 -if SWD -vd`

To enable logs, you can change the feature flags on each crate.  Then logs will be output via semihosting to your SWD debugger.
```
# Enable logs on the root crate and a few of the local crate dependencies.
cargo run --release --features board-lpcxpresso55,log-all,fido-authenticator/log-all,ctaphid-dispatch/log-info,ctap-types/log-all
```
