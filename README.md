## Building

### Prerequisites

On Ubuntu or Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install llvm clang
```

Install [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your system.


### Boards

Head to [runnners/lpc55/board](runners/lpc55/board) for an overview on the possible embedded platforms the firmware
currently supports.

### Compiling

Head to [runners/lpc55](runners/lpc55) to get started, and try `make build-dev`, which compiles
the entire firmware bundle using features convenient for getting started.

With `make run-dev`, it will try to connect to a GDB server to flash and run the firmware.
One way to run a GDB server is `JLinkGDBServer -strict -device LPC55S69 -if SWD -vd`

To enable logs, you can change the feature flags on each crate.  Then logs will be output via semihosting to your SWD debugger.
```
# Enable logs on the root crate and a few of the local crate dependencies.
cargo run --release --features board-lpcxpresso55,log-all,fido-authenticator/log-all,hid-dispatch/log-info,ctap-types/log-all
```
